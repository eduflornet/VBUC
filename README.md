## Experiment Log

### Current Status
- **Start Date**: October 28, 2025
- **VBUC Version**: [To be determined]
- **Target Framework**: .NET 9
- **Original VB6 Project**: SKS (Stock Management System)

### Experiments

#### Experiment 1: Initial Migration Analysis
**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Objective**: Analyze the initial VBUC migration output and identify areas for improvement

**Findings**:
- [ ] Code migration accuracy assessment
- [ ] UI component conversion quality
- [ ] Database connectivity migration
- [ ] Error handling pattern conversion
- [ ] Performance comparison

**Issues Found**:
- [ ] List issues here as they are discovered

**Improvements Made**:
- [ ] Document code improvements here

#### Experiment 2: [Next Experiment Title]
**Date**: [Date]  
**Status**: Planned  
**Objective**: [Describe objective]

## Benchmarking Results

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | VB6 Original | .NET Migrated | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Startup Time | - | - | - |
| Memory Usage | - | - | - |
| Database Operations | - | - | - |
| UI Response Time | - | - | - |

### Code Quality Metrics
| Metric | Before | After | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Lines of Code | - | - | - |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | - | - | - |
| Code Duplication | - | - | - |
| Technical Debt | - | - | - |

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Functional Tests**: Verify that migrated functionality works as expected
2. **Performance Tests**: Compare performance between original and migrated code
3. **Regression Tests**: Ensure no functionality is lost during migration
4. **UI Tests**: Verify user interface behavior and appearance

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test category
dotnet test --filter Category=Functional
dotnet test --filter Category=Performance
```
